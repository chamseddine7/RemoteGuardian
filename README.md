# 🕊️ Remote Guardian

> *"Looks like a little helper angel... until you realize it’s running your other phone like a command center."*

**Remote Guardian** is a lightweight but powerful Android remote administration tool. It allows secure, live access to a second Android device — letting you browse files, trigger actions, pull system data, and more — all from your main phone. Cute name, serious control. 😎
